Hello, I maintain a Bulgarian server for your KP LIBERATION missions and we are very pleased with them !!! My request and my question to you and the creators of these missions is the following: Can you make a mission KP LIBERATION on an existing Afghanistan map, but in the menu for buying bots, creating bots to make Bulgarian bots for our Bulgarian server? I will also give you the relevant Bulgarian addons, add-ons to use for bots and equipment against the Taliban. Here are the addons:
