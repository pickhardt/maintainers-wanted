## Submitting

Please make a pull request with the project added to this readme.

The requirements for accepting are simple:

1. The PR follows the formatting in use already. Please keep the list alphabetized.

2. The project must have at least 100 stars (if on Github). If it's not on Github, I'll use my best judgment as to whether it's worth including.

3. There must be a way to validate the project is open to new maintainers. That could be an open issue, a notice, it looks like it's been abandoned, or you are the lead yourself.

4. Please only post if the project is looking for a new lead maintainer, suggesting the current maintainer would like to deprioritize or move on. (Most projects are open to new contributors at all times.)
